\section*{
    Problem Statement
}

Write a program to create a "reflected" word, whose input value is specified in memory location 0200.
The output should be placed in register A.  Two versions: one that uses field specifications for manipulating
parts of words and one that does not.

\section*{
    Analysis
}

I have written two solutions that focus on moving the individual bytes around in the registers and scraps 
them back together as efficiently as I could manage in a reasonable amout of time.
