\section*{Data Structure of the Linked List}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fairly uncontroversial information on one node linking to the next
    \item This fairly short subchapter ends up being mostly a further elucidation on the usage of mixal along with a very light introduction to the idea of linking records together
\end{itemize}

\section*{Usage of MIXAL}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Usage of fields as pointers to other records
    \item The EQU mixal directive -- used to implement a constant that can be used as a field modifier
\end{itemize}
