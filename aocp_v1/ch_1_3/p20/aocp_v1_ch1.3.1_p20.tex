Compose a mixal program that writes HLT to every memory address.

\section*{
    Analysis
}

HLT is opcode 5 with a field expression of 2, which numerically evaluates to a value of 133.
Writing the instructions to write over memory addresses that are not part of the instructions
in the program is a matter of copying 133 into each memory location in a loop.  Replacing the
program itself in memory must be achieved in a single, final instruction and that is where
MOVE comes in.  The last instruction moves values from a section already full of HLT
instructions into the memory previously occupied by the code.  Conveniently, no matter where
the jump register ends up, it will be HLT, so no HLT is required in the Mixal description of
the program.
