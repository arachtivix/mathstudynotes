    Problem Statement
}

Write a program that computes $x^13$ using the fewest instructions.  Write a
program that computes $x^13$ using the least running time.  The value of $x$
can be found in memory cell 2000.  The result should be placed in register A
when the program execution ends.

\section*{
    Analysis
}

The maximum possible value for a mix register or a memory cell
is 1073741824 and because this system uses an explicit sign,
the minimum is -1073741824.  For positive $x$, the largest
possible value whose thirteenth power will fit in such a cell
or register will be $4^{13}=67108864$ because $5^{13}=1220703125 >
1073741824$.  This means the problem may be susceptible to a
simple lookup table approach, which should suffice for the
execution time version in any case and possibly for the
program size one if we cannot get another version to less
than the size of the lookup table plus a couple instructions
to handle the lookup.  In my estimation, this puts a ceiling
for the instruction size version at about 11 or 12 instructions
as the lookup table will be 9 and all we really need is to
set an offset and copy to the A register based on the offset.
