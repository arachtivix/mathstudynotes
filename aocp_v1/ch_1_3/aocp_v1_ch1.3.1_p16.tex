    Problem Statement
}

Write a mix program that writes memory cells 0000-0099 to zero.

\section*{
    Analysis
}

For a verifiable, practical implementation, this program
 will have to load something into the memory cells that 
 can be read to check, rather than zeros, but the idea is
 the same.  This problem will be a good way to
 get some of the fundamentals of the GNU emulator down.
