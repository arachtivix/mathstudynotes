# Project info

This is a playground I'm using to try Amazon Q and mess around with blender 3 (because apaprently debian doesn't support 4... fist shaking emoji) to create some chess animations.

Blender version 3.4.1

# Chess Board Position Format

The `create_chessboard()` function now returns a list of tuples containing position information for each square on the chess board. Each tuple contains:

1. x coordinate (float) - World space X position
2. y coordinate (float) - World space Y position
3. z coordinate (float) - World space Z position (fixed at 0.1 above board)
4. file (str) - Chess file notation ('a' through 'h')
5. rank (str) - Chess rank notation ('1' through '8')
6. is_white (bool) - True for white squares, False for black squares

Example tuple:
```python
(0.25, -0.75, 0.1, 'c', '3', True)  # White square at c3
```

What amazes me is that Q did this for me.
