\section*{Problem 202: Laserbeam}


Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

\par
Label the vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$. There are $2$ ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex $C$, bounce off $11$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.

\end{center}
There are $80840$ ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex $C$, bounce off $1000001$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.

\par
In how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex $C$, bounce off $12017639147$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?

\section*{Notes}

These mirror problems often rely on the idea that a 'bounce' is equivalent to continuing along a straight line while flipping the coordinates of the rest of the world.  In this model we can view the problem as involving a linear path between equivalent points on a grid.  The problem will likely turn on creating a systematic way to identify grid points and a function to count line traversals or bounces between two of them.

\par

Identify points by their displacement from the center and how many rows deep they are.  So $[0, 0]$ is the origin, $[2, 3]$ is 2 hops from the center to the right and 3 layers deep, and $[-5, 0]$ is 5 hops to the left but not any further forward than the origin, which means it cannot actually be reached.  Any vertex $[a, b]$ cannot be reached if $b < 0$ or if $|b| > a$.

\par

There is one more type of point that could be described by this coordinate system and could actually be reached in many cases, but will be excluded for the analysis.  An example of this would be $[0, 1]$, which would be halfway between A and B on the problem description.  Similarly $[1, 2]$ and $[-1, 2]$ are on lines between proper vertices.  More generally, a point $[a, b]$ is a proper vertex if $a$'s remainder when dividing by two is equal to $b$'s remainer when dividing by two.
