\section*{Problem 202: Laserbeam}


Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

\par
Label the vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$. There are $2$ ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex $C$, bounce off $11$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.

There are $80840$ ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex $C$, bounce off $1000001$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.

\par
In how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex $C$, bounce off $12017639147$ surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?

\section*{Notes}

These mirror problems often rely on the idea that a 'bounce' is equivalent to continuing along a straight line while flipping the coordinates of the rest of the world.  In this model we can view the problem as involving a linear path between equivalent points on a grid.  The problem will likely turn on creating a systematic way to identify grid points and a function to count line traversals or bounces between two of them.
