\subsection{Solution Approaches}

The code presents two solution approaches:

\subsubsection{First Approach}
\begin{lstlisting}
(defn sol1 [] (take 1 (filter is-root-of-hidden-sq? (range min-n max-n))))
\end{lstlisting}

This is a naive brute-force approach that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Defines the maximum and minimum possible values based on the pattern
    \item Takes their square roots to get the search range
    \item Filters numbers whose squares match the pattern
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Slightly Narrower Approach}
\begin{lstlisting}
(defn is-m-sq?
  [m]
  (matches-pattern?
   '(1 :_ 2 :_ 3 :_ 4 :_ 5 :_ 6 :_ 7 :_ 8 :_ 9)
   (dec-exp-int (* m m))))

(defn sol2 [] 
  (take 1 (filter is-m-sq? (range min-m max-m))))
\end{lstlisting}

This is another approach that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses an intermediate step mentioned in the problem writeup
    \item Reduces the search space by looking at a shorter pattern
    \item Still uses brute force but over a smaller range
\end{itemize}

Both approaches are noted to be time-consuming, suggesting that further optimization might be needed for an efficient solution.
