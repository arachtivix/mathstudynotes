# NumPy 2.x Compatibility Fix

## Issue
The script `glass_ball_demo.py` is failing due to NumPy version incompatibility. The error indicates that a module was compiled with NumPy 1.x but is being run with NumPy 2.2.4.

## Solution
To resolve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Downgrade NumPy (Recommended for immediate fix)**
   ```bash
   pip install "numpy<2"
   ```

2. **Wait for Module Updates**
   The underlying modules need to be updated to support NumPy 2.x. This may take time as module maintainers work on compatibility.

## Technical Details
- The error indicates this is a binary compatibility issue between NumPy 1.x and 2.x
- Critical modules using the numpy.core.multiarray are failing to import
- This is a known issue with the NumPy 2.0 transition

## Long-term Recommendation
While downgrading to NumPy 1.x will work as an immediate fix, the long-term solution is to:
1. Monitor the dependencies for updates that support NumPy 2.x
2. Update the dependencies once they support NumPy 2.x
3. Then upgrade NumPy to version 2.x

For now, please use the downgrade solution to get the script working again.
