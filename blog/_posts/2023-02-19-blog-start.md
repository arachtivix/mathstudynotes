I've been puttering around with LaTeX and the GNU Mixal Development Kit for a little while now.  These are both outgrowths of my efforts to improve my data structures knowledge through reading Knuth's The Art of Programming.  As a further outgrowth, directly owing to the MDK, I've acquired an interest in Guile, which I've used to script some of the tests I'm writing for my MDK programs.  I've barely scratched the surface of any of this and none of this is really intended for an external audience yet, if ever it is.  Instead, this repo is a place to keep my work safely and this blog is a way to track my progress and reflect on the things I do here.
