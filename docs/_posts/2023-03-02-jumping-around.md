I find myself pondering the meaning of the traversal algorithm for this book found in its own front matter.  It is clearly meant to be a bit of meta-humor by the author, but I can't help but think there's some statement here as well.  The interpretation of this first figure seems deliberately troublesome or ambiguous, but seems to convey the distinct impression of struggle.  Today I have tried to pick up this project again for an hour or so.  I've been preoccupied with other matters in my life for a little over a week now, but I am free for the moment.  I've decided to peruse a blessedly short chapter: 2.1, which contains some fairly straightforward statements about links between entities represented in a computer, but nonetheless contains parts I will need to work through.

The book also mentions the Lisp language in this chapter in passing, which I found fun since I have spent some time with the language here.
