title: Cards
--

This week I started work on the first problems in chapter 2.1.  I've decided to implement some scripting so I can easily place the card construct described in the text into the MIX machine memory before starting a test.  In a rather classic rabbit hole style I wanted to implement a hash table using some Guile symbols as keys for a hash table to their numerical equivalents.  The problem is this is one more layer than I need right now.  I've come to my senses and decided to implement things more simply.
