title: Metapalindromes
---

I had a fun idea for a number pattern yesterday while reading some of the beginning of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: take a number and square it, then take the reverse of the number and square that.  If the first square is a palindrome of the second, then the number is a metapalindrome. I wrote a python script to churn these out and, if my script is correct (which is not a guarantee at this point), there's an interesting behavior.  All the numbers that fit have only 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's in their digits.  I don't know why that would be, but perhaps I will consider it further later.
