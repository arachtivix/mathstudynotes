title: Slow Drip

There is an oddly large amount of work that goes into laying out solutions in Mixal, writing a test runner, analyzing the (so far simple) problem, and looking through the book solution.  The book inevitably has a much more elegant solution than I did, and it's often credited by name, so I'm taking this to mean it's been a bit competitive even this early on in the book.  I've been looking at ways to improve and automate parts of my process, but those efforts are sometimes overambitious for the need.  I'd definitely like to find a way to get the Guile scripts to generate a few figures for the LaTeX writeups though, but we shall see.
